          <p class="latests-content"><i>The European Council of Defence Ministers has reached a new agreement seeking to tighten sea patrols in the Mediterranean Sea after persistent complaints from southern EU members Italy and Spain.</i> &nbsp | Turkish President Recep Tayep Erdogan and his minister of Energy and Mining expressed cautious welcome to a proposal fielded by the Kremlin last week regarding a significant expansion of the existing TurkStream gas pipeline in what the Russian authorities hope will be a strategic shift from the setbacks of the European refusal to participate in the Russian attempts at selling their oil and gas in Europe for Roubles -thereby weathering the impacts of the sanctions<br><br> The action is a controversial move since it will be seen by Western leaders as helping Russia in several tactical and strategic ways. First, the Russians will be able to keep selling gas despite the freezing of sales and dramatic sabotage of the NordStream 1 & 2 pipelines. Second, it will help a long-standing, and particularly urgent at the moment, Russian objective of splitting the Western allies and Europe in particular, since many Balkan and East-European states including Greece, Serbia, Hungary and Slovakia have had good ties to Russia and depend on its gas, thus allowing them to reverse their gas/oil bans in coming years- something that the U.S.-led NATO alliance is particularly unwilling to see. Third, this move cements the Russia-Turkish ties and strengthen the Erdogan government at a time of significant economic difficulty and high inflation - particularly because expanding TurkStream will allow Türkiye to gain more, cheaper Russian gas and gain from any transit fees charged to any European countries that do accept this new pipeline. Or potentially, the Turks could create their own export/shipping infstructure in coming years and sell Russian gas to Asian or other markets.<br><br>
          Despite Western reservations about this latest Russian manoeuvre, the Turkish President and his energy minister declared themselves to be <q class="quote">fully interested</q> in the proposal, suggesting that this was <q class="quote">in the national interests of Türkiye</q>. The Kremlin will be delighted with the Turkish response and this is a further instance of the non-Western world's ambivalent stance toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine that will be triggering furrowed brows in Western capitals.Despite their best efforts, even traditionally Western-friendly countries in Asia, Latin American and Africa such as Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and India have sought to take an independent approach to the conflict which is now entering its 10th month. &nbsp <strong>Reporting by Julie Andressen | Additional reporting from Frank Khyrsa | Editing by Gabriella Ricciardi.</strong>

      <p class="latests-content"><i>Algeria is hosting Russian naval and special forces for training excercises- initially at sea and later in the country's vast desert.</i> &nbsp | The Russian military will be sending special forces, marines and sailors for joint naval and land excercises. The two countries have been long-standing allies since the mid-Cold War, with Algeria being a persistent and major client of Russian arms manufacturers as well as a close OPEC+ ally. Algeria's significant gas reserves have made it especially strategic given its proximity to Europe and existing dual gas pipelines linking up to Spain and Italy.<br><br> Nevertheless, although Algiers has sought to underline its continuing interest in maintaining good relations with Europe and the United States, several developments both before and after the outbreak of the Ukraine war has significantly worsenened relations between it and the NATO alliance countries, to the benefit of the Russia-Algeria alliance. In 2021 changes in Western, especially the United States' policy regarding the Western Sahara's status at the behest of Morocco and in tandem with the shift in the same countries' views on the status of Jerusalem infuriated and concerned the Algerian government, which was already under pressure from the instability of the collapse of the previous Bouteflika government and the rise of a massive peaceful protest movement as well as ongoing Moroccan irredentism regarding both the Western Sahara and Algeria territorial integrity.<br><br>
      The situation worsened with the debacle of Spanish interference on this issue, which led to a freezing of Algiers' commercial ties with Madrid, including the sale of gas at preferential rates- something which Algiers had undertaken at a significant trouble in order to ensure Spanish relations were maintained while it had turned off the taps on its gas pipeline (in response to abysmal relations with Morocco).<br><br> Although in the immediate aftermath of the February Russian invasion of Ukraine there seemed to be an improvement in Western-Algerian relations due to the sudden search for non-Russian gas to solve the EU's quandary, which led to multiple foreign leaders and ministers including the U.S.' Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and French President Macron visiting Algiers, the Algerian authorites have been steadfast in their support of Russia. <br><br>As with China, Algeria's own core priniciple of non-intervention and focus on a Westphalian sovereigntist model of international relations has not stopped it from supporting the Russians at a time when they have trampled those Westphalian sovereigntist principles in relation to Ukraine, including the permanent annexation of Ukrainian territory. These excercies, alongside multiple Algerian votes at the United Nations in favour of Russia, are signs of a hardening stance, moving away from the country's generally neutralist 'non-aligned' stance. This will inevitably delight Moscow and cause further tensions as well as more Western alignment with Algeria's primary rival, Morocco.<br><br> The Kremlin will be delighted with the Turkish response and this is a further instance of the non-Western world's ambivalent stance toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine that will be causing furrowed brows in Western capitals.Despite their best efforts, even traditionally Western-friendly countries in Asia, Latin American and Africa such as Argentina, Brazil, South Africa and India have sought to take an independent approch to the conflict which is now entering its 10th month. &nbsp

    <p class="latests-content"><i>The 27th meeting of the UN's Conference of Parties on Climate Change is being held over the next fortnight in Egypt's Red Sea tourist hotspot, Sharm El-Sheikh.</i><br><br> Egypt has beefed up security in the city given that the event represents an important milestone for the country's attempts at improving its image of order and sense of purpose following years of economic and political fallout in the aftermath of the chaotic post-Arab Spring readjustment as well as ongoing difficulties, especially in the context of globally high food and energy prices for the major resources importer.
    <br><br> The Abdelfattah al-Sisi government has ensured that entire swathes of the tourist city will be curtained off to ensure that the conference happens without any glitches. Egypt has struggled to improve its reputation and image, both as a safe place for tourism which is an invaluable source of revenues and foreign currencies, as well as to brush off international criticisms of its human rights records that have seen multiple notorious cases including the jailing of the former Muslim Brotherhood leader and President Mohammed Morsi as well as the killings of many of his supporters, the death of Italian PhD. researcher Giulo Regeni, and the multiple other imprisonments of political figures over the past decade since the 2011 Arab Spring revolution.
    <br><br>But the tough stance has elicited criticisms, especially from COP activists and non-governmental organisations who claim that the measures have made it effectively financially prohibitive, if not impossible, to attend. Many among those voices argue that the very spirit of locking away the conference in the shrowd of security and exclusivity is precisely the opposite of what is required as the climate discussion needs to be more open and more public than ever before.

    <p class="latests-content"><i>Israel has agreed to a U.S-supervised deal with Lebanon regarding maritime border allowing exloitation and export of gas, but Syria cancels talks with Lebanon signalling its frustration.</i> &nbsp | Israel's foreign minister Yair Lapid confirmed on Monday that the country has reached a deal with Lebanon to settled the two countries' maritime border. Lebanon's President Michel Aoun also expressed his optimism that the deal would be <q class="quote">good for Lebanon's economic recovery</q>. The two countries are technically in a state of frozen war since the 1982 Israeli invasion which came in reaction to the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's irredentist nationalist movement from Lebanon in the 1970s. Recent years have seen rocky relations between the countries, especially during the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, with the latter - which is a Shia Islamist movement backed by Iran and partly dedicated the liberation of Palestine.<br><br> The ongoing Syrian war (2011-) has reignited the massive tensions both within Lebanon due to an unmanageable influx of Syrian refugees, an economic collapse, as well as between the countries due to Israel's arrogation of its claim to pre-emptive intervention in Syria to check the growing role of Hizbullah and Iran - particularly via violations of Lebanese airspace as a means to attack Syrian-based Hizbullah and Iranian facilities.<br><br> Despite this tense situation between Israel and Lebanon, the current worldwide inflation in food and energy prices has made both countries' interests in securing their own reliable gas supply as well as potentially exporting it to an energy-starved and increasingly desperate Europe - as Russian gas has petered out - means that the, under the U.S. guidance, the two governments have managed to agree to the formalisation of their maritime border in order to settled gas exploitation. French energy giant Total has already affirmed its stake in a gas exploitation effort on the Lebanese side. <br><br> In contrast to this seemingly positive development, the Syrian government confirmed late yesterday that planned talks with Lebanon had been cancelled by Damascus. Lebanon and Syria, like Israel and most countries in the Middle East, are the result of 20th Century political and administrative organisation, primarily by the former imperial powers in the region, Britain and France. In Ottoman and Islamic periods, the two countries were not separated, nor even concieved in a Westphalian idea of territorially bounded sovereign states- but rather as regional and administrative areas. Syria's nationalist and pan-Arab/pan-Syrian ideologies during the Cold War further solidified the Damascus elites underlying skepticism regarding a separate Lebanese nation-state; percieving it with some historical justification as being a French colonial creation. In 1982, it also intervened in Lebanon, primarily in reaction to Israel's intervention.<br><br>Although the territorial border between the countries is formalised now, the maritime border still has an area of dispute where Lebanon rejects a Syrian claim on a part of the sea out from the western Syrian region of Lattakia, which borders north Lebanon. However, with time, and following major Lebanese uprisings that led to Syria formally leaving Lebanon in 2006- although its influence has been continual. During the collapse of the country in the past decade of civil war, its impact has continued to irk the independentist leaders in Lebanon. This Syrian rejection of Lebanese talks will ineviatbly be interpreted as a sign of frustration, especially since Damascus' nemesis, Tel Aviv, has reached its own deal with Lebanon.<p class="separator" id="article-5"></p>

    <p class="latests-content"><i>France's national police authorities have reported that a fibre-optic cable linking the south of France to the North-West of Spain has been cut in a seeming act of sabotage.</i> &nbsp | Occurring one month after the sabotage attack on the Nord Stream pipelines and a week after confirmed sabotage to an undersea internet cable connecting the Shetland Islands to mainland Scotland which is still being investigated by Scottish authorities, this latest development is raising concerns about a deteriorating energy and telecommunications infrastructure situation for Europe in the midst of the Ukraine conflict.<br><br> Although French and Spanish authorites have officially said that the matter is still being investigated, anonymous sources noted that the same line had already experienced a cut some time before. Cuts to internet undersea cables can occur due to fishing trawler lines getting hooked and pulling the cables- they are not as well protected as a gas pipeline to resist such pressures. However, the officials mentioned that the frequency of such events had certainly raised eyebrows, although they stressed investigations were ongoing.<br><br> An internet monitoring service noted that there had been a quantifiable lowering of the speed of internet not only in Europe but worldwide, a result of the way that the internet functions, with internet packets being sent regardless of source and destination by whichever is the least congested route, thus meaning that even geographically distant places such as Latin America and South-East Asia can be affected by such 'broken links in the chain'. This is especially the case with fibre-optic cabling, in which data travels near the speed of light, meaning the shortest route for data packets is often based on traffic, rather than geographic distance.<br><br>
